DTSC-610-Weather-Data-Analysis
Here's a brief summary of the work done focused on weather data analysis and visualization for outdoor activity planning:

Data Cleaning and Aggregation: A Weather Data Aggregator Class was implemented to combine, normalize, and aggregate multiple weather datasets efficiently. Error handling mechanisms were integrated into the data cleaning process to handle unexpected data formats, missing data, and outliers effectively.

Enhanced Visualization: A Custom Visualization Class was developed for advanced weather data visualizations, extending the functionalities of matplotlib and seaborn. Interactive elements were incorporated for enhanced data exploration, providing more comprehensive insights into weather conditions.

Forecast Comparison: A function was created to visually compare temperature forecasts between two cities, enabling users to make informed decisions based on weather variations.

Aggregate Data Analysis: A method was implemented to analyze temperature and humidity data, determining the best time of day for outdoor activities. This function aids in identifying optimal outdoor activity timings based on weather conditions.

Weather Metrics Computation: Functions were developed to compute average temperature and humidity from weather data, providing essential metrics for outdoor activity planning.
